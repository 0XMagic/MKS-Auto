# How to use

1. Set up config.json to your steamapps directory
2. Drag and drop your .tga files onto the python script. (All non-tga files are ignored.)
3. Name the output texture file when prompted.
4. Enjoy!

### Making multiple sequences

* Simply name your image files like this: "(Category)-(Filename).tga"
* Each "category" will be its own sequence in the final texture.
* Categories are sorted alphabetically.
* If you don't like the splitter character being -, edit line 10 of the script.

#### Notes:

* Files are sorted alphabetically, so make sure they are named correctly to prevent your sequences from being out of
  order.
* You DO NOT have to credit me if you use this script to make workshop items.
