# How to use

1. Move the python file AND your images into your target directory.
2. Drag and drop your .tga files onto the python file. (All non-tga files are ignored.)
3. Name the output mks file when prompted.
4. Enjoy!


### Making multiple sequences
* Simply name your image files like this: "(Category)0(Filename).tga"
* Each "category" will be its own sequence.
* Categories are sorted alphabetically.
* If you don't like the splitter character being 0, edit line 5 of the script.


#### Notes:
* Files are sorted alphabetically, so make sure they are named correctly to prevent your sequence from being out of order.
